RINDOTSH's REFLECTOR UPDATER:

This is a simple bash script that will help update your pacman mirrorlist with reflector without having to type out the entire command
Script takes into account that you may not have reflector installed and can help you install it

To download the latest version of this script:
    git clone https://github.com/rindotsh/reflector-updater

ps: this is my first ever actual coding project, a small but good start. Here's to many more.

To run this script, do chmod +x ~/reflector-updater/install.sh and then ./install.sh which contains both installation and uninstallation, should you want to remove this script
