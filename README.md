RINDOTSH's REFLECTOR UPDATER:

This is a simple bash script that will help update your mirrorlist with reflector without having to type out the entire command
Script takes into account that you may not have reflector installed and can help you install it

To download the latest version of this script:
    git clone https://github.com/rindotsh/reflector-updater
ps: this is my first ever actual coding project, a small but good start. Here's to many more.
